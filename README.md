# untis-to-google-calendar
Synchronize Untis timetable to Google Calendar

It reads in Untis exported XML file and splits it into multitude of Google Calendars.
There will be separate calendar for each study group, for each room and for each teacher.
There will be generated on common index file with all these three lists accessible from web.
Index file is generated by custom HTML/CSS template.

Google Calendars have multiple uses:
* For techer/student: see your calendar in your Android along other events
* Parent: have your offspring timetible in your Android
* Managers: compare many calendars side by side (good for planning common events)
* Have actual view of your time (minutes, hours) rather that conceptual (classes).
* Much easier to access from mobile phone than launching and searching web
